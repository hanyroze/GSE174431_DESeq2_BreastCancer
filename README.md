# Differential Expression Analysis of Breast Cancer PBMCs (GSE174431)

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a **bioinformatics pipeline** for analyzing RNA-seq data using **R and DESeq2**.  
The dataset comes from **GSE174431** (GEO), which contains RNA-seq profiles of **lineage-positive (Lin+)** and **lineage-negative (Lin–)** populations isolated from PBMCs of metastatic breast cancer patients.  

The objective was to identify **differentially expressed genes (DEGs)** and visualize sample clustering and expression patterns.

##  Methods
1. Downloaded raw exon count files from **GEO** (`GSE174431_RAW.tar`).  
2. Processed and merged count files into a matrix in **R**.  
3. Annotated samples using metadata (`LinPositive vs LinNegative`).  
4. Performed **DESeq2 analysis**:
   - Normalization
   - PCA for QC
   - Differential expression testing
   - Multiple testing correction (FDR < 0.05)  
5. Generated visualizations:
   - PCA plot
   - Volcano plot
   - Heatmap of top 20 DEGs

##  Results

### PCA Plot
Samples cluster clearly by lineage group (Lin+ vs Lin–), confirming biological separation.

### Volcano Plot
Differentially expressed genes between **Lin+** and **Lin–**.

### Heatmap of Top 20 DEGs
The top 20 genes show distinct expression patterns between groups.

### Top 20 DE Genes (Table)
| Gene | log2FC | Adj.P.Val |
|------|--------|-----------|
| ExampleGene1 | +2.45 | 3.2e-06 |
| ExampleGene2 | -1.78 | 7.1e-05 |
| ... | ... | ... |

##  Conclusion
- **Lin– cells** (lineage-negative) display expression consistent with **stem-like / progenitor states**.  
- **Lin+ cells** (lineage-positive) show **differentiated gene expression profiles**.  
- Results align with the hypothesis that Lin– cells may act as **cancer stem-like populations** in breast cancer.

##  Portfolio Value
This project demonstrates:
- RNA-seq preprocessing
- DESeq2 workflow
- Data visualization (PCA, Volcano, Heatmap)
- Clear scientific reporting  

This repository demonstrates a reproducible RNA-seq differential expression workflow using DESeq2 in R. The project analyzes the GSE174431 breast cancer dataset (lineage-positive vs lineage-negative PBMC samples) and serves as a portfolio example for freelance bioinformatics and academic consulting.
